Turn any keyboard key into a toggleable Morse straight key.

Use the keybind Ctrl+\` to activate Morse mode. In this mode, your space bar will be interpreted as a Morse straight key; if you tap out a recognizable Morse character, it'll type that character for you. Press the keybind to toggle Morse mode off, or press Escape first to fully quit.

Want to play around with the expected Morse speed, the delay between spaces and words, the keyboard key used as a Morse key, or the Morse mode keybind itself? Feel free to tinker with the constants at the top of the script.
